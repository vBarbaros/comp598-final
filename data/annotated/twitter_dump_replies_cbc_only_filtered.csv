When was the vaccine first formulated? 
What kind of variant was it made to cover? 
It's easily available information.",,

It is not just ""the same"" outcome if you are not vaccinated at all. That is just not true.",,

If someone chooses no vaccine, no mask, no distancing, no measures because of beliefs I do not have to respect that. Choices have consequences.",,

So far you sound like a pompous, arrogant liberal who only believes in a mainstream narrative and thinks that a slight deviation from it is a deadly sin.
