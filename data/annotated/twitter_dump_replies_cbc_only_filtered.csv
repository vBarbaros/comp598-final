1.46534907364139e+18,"@BBCPolitics Sajid Javid rightly called out somebody on twitter for complaining of being offered a mixed dose of vaccines. My complaint is the opposite! I want a different vaccine, it makes sense and paid off in Canada.

1.465294474687492e+18,@CBCAlerts This is impossible. You have already told us that only the vaccinated can fly and that keeps everyone safe. And we really donâ€™t have to worry anyways because we have vaccine passports to give us extra protection. So no need to worry people. Our leaders have this under control. ðŸ˜‚,,

1.4651363931733197e+18,@CBCAlerts So this is more than evidence that vaccinated people can catch and spread the virus. Only vaccinated people can travel at this moment abroad canada. So what more proof they want that this vaccine is not working.,,
