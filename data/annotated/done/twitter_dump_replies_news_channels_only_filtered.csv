1.4652002270239334e+18,@picardonhealth @geoffreyyork @globeandmail So you honestly think vaccine equity is going to slow down variants that much - at the end of 3 years from now we will still have a billion people who don‚Äôt get the shot - many of which don‚Äôt want it (I do). And I bet a good 50% of vaccinated will catch Covid &amp; make variants,,,

1.4651463301966316e+18,"@globeandmail The ""vaccine"" doesn't prevent transmission, contraction, hospitalization, or death. The headline makes no sense whatsoever.
