@CBCNews You really not gonna be able to force the global South (the vaccine hesitant ones) to take the vaccination. Don't see how the world is gonna fix this situation..,,,
@picardonhealth @geoffreyyork @globeandmail So you honestly think vaccine equity is going to slow down variants that much - at the end of 3 years from now we will still have a billion people who don‚Äôt get the shot - many of which don‚Äôt want it (I do). And I bet a good 50% of vaccinated will catch Covid &amp; make variants,,,
"@CBCNews the vaccine doesnt prevent the current variants, why would anyone think it will prevent the newer one?",,,
"@Marilyn210156 @JaimeJaime905 @CBCNews Yep, so has the information about about the effectiveness of the vaccine.",,,
"@M00NF0XX @nationalpost Canada will push hard on vaccines to use up supply and to look like they're being proactive, based off assumption ""some"" vax is better than no vax (without evidence). WHO suggesting vaccine will be far less effective as stopping spread. Vax pass is forever and new shots coming",,,
"@DanielBechtel7 @the_meghaning @nationalpost The actual percentages matter, Dan. Healthy eating and exercise lowers your risk of infection from 1 in 6 to around 1 in 60. The vaccine lowers it from 1 in 6 to around 1 in 12,000.",,,
"@Goalie66191779 @CBCNews i cant believe we have to live with people like you who are so misinformed, as you spew your hated and vitriol on people who decided to wait for more facts to come out. we are glad we didnt take your experimental vaccine, because theyre causing heart attacks!",,,
"@globeandmail Yes, we have a new variant, 32 mutations to the S1.
Makes it highly contagious, but so far more mild.
This is the trend of viral evolution, more spread less dead. Will omicron follow this trend? Maybe
What‚Äôs interesting is the number of mutations just against vaccine antibodies",,,
@virusTruth2 @nationalpost Can you name a vaccine that is 100% preventative? Smallpox would still be rampant if we all followed your logic.,,,
@woostiii @picardonhealth @globeandmail You believe that? You probably still believe if you get the vaccine you won't catch the virus.  I don't fear anything. I had it. I spent a day practicing golf in the sunshine and a few bowls of chicken soup. What more is there to do?,,,
"@globeandmail The ""vaccine"" doesn't prevent transmission, contraction, hospitalization, or death. The headline makes no sense whatsoever.

Because it's a non-sterlizing therapeutic being used on a mass scale, the exact opposite is likely true with the ""vaccines"" driving mutations.",,,
@nationalpost You should probably also take a test for inflammation markers and ACS risk since research is coming out that mRNA vaccine increases these.,,,
@BrineyBarbarian @Michell28462861 @CBCNews Does it depend on whether the current vaccine is effective against this particular variant?,,,
"@BrineyBarbarian @Michell28462861 @CBCNews It's the vaccine causing selective pressure on the virus to mutate the spike, wake up",,,
@sajanorth22 @MJPatchouli @CBCNews Perhaps those same Cons would like to disclose the vaccine status of ALL their members???,,,
"@kishkitsch @PaulH551 @diana_c2021 @nationalpost Nov 24: SA says no more vaxs

"@CBCAlerts Yes, they can develop both a test and a vaccine overnight without ever isolating the virus-but can they build a mouse trap if they have never seen a mouse?",,,

@nspector4 @JustinTrudeau @globeandmail @SylviaStead Early cases of Omicron in Botswana were double vaxxed but that hasn‚Äôt stopped a certain crowd from hammering their vaccine inequity narrative.,,,
"@CBCNews Amazing CBC, real news !!!!! Good job !Now try reporting about vaccine deaths and injuries and how the vaccines don‚Äôt work but they are still pushing them ! How hundreds of thousands of people could have been saved with early inexpensive treatments ! How babies are stillborn !!",,,
"@Norbsters @MelDCanada @CBCNews Vaxxers: I question nothing. For my protection, I wear a mask in public and practice social distancing even though I received 2-3 vaccine shots. My sleeve is rolled up for the 4th.",,,
"@Cleetwan @globeandmail Vaccine passport or social credit system dosen't stop the spread of anything!
It does however give people a false sense of security and way too much government control over the person",,,
@CBCAlerts @CBCNews Thank goodness for those vaccine passports right? Only the vaccinated can come and go as they please right? Still trusting the science?,,,
@CBCAlerts This is impossible. You have already told us that only the vaccinated can fly and that keeps everyone safe. And we really don‚Äôt have to worry anyways because we have vaccine passports to give us extra protection. So no need to worry people. Our leaders have this under control. üòÇ,,,
"@BBCPolitics Sajid Javid rightly called out somebody on twitter for complaining of being offered a mixed dose of vaccines. My complaint is the opposite! I want a different vaccine, it makes sense and paid off in Canada.

"@nationalpost Those same SJW's are villainizing the unvaccinated.
Are they not vaccine hoarders?
They want to have it both ways.
As usual, like selfish, spoiled children.

Too bad for the shrill set the omicron variant is mildly infectious, even with South Africa's low 24% vaccination rate.",,,
"@globeandmail Yeah, so much equity - let‚Äôs force the entire African continent into submission and take the vaccine, which they seem not to need, but we in the West need them to take. Interesting https://t.co/TuYhbqnh4O",,,
"@DanielBechtel7 @the_meghaning @nationalpost You @DanielBechtel7 keep misrepresenting the vaccine as something it isn‚Äôt to sell a mythological ‚Äúnatural‚Äù versus ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù dichotomy. You clearly have done no research into the vaccine itself, how it is administered, or what it does. You‚Äôve just looked for out of context info.",,,
"@nationalpost @rupasubramanya ""So indeed, some countries are doing better than others. For instance, we have Angola, Eswatini, Gambia, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda - countries that have used up 100% of their COVAX doses because they all had a robust vaccine rollout.""

@DanielBechtel7 @the_meghaning @nationalpost I feel that qualified medical professionals who are all saying take the vaccine are right. You are not giving solid health advice. In fact you are giving terrible health advice. Push ups alone are not exercising and refusing to take a vaccine shows a lack of health experience.,,,

@DanielBechtel7 @the_meghaning @nationalpost Says the guy who assumes people don‚Äôt want to exercise because they‚Äôre telling him that exercise alone is not better than taking a vaccine. Lol. You‚Äôre the one who is surface only and thinks working out is as good as vaccination.,,,
@CBCNews Ok lets end the mandates and move on.  We know vaccinated spread.. they even spread omicron.  Vaccine companies still trying to figure out it's effectiveness. Might come out with variant specific. So let's stop pushing these genes for some real normlacy.,,,

@CBCAlerts So this is more than evidence that vaccinated people can catch and spread the virus. Only vaccinated people can travel at this moment abroad canada. So what more proof they want that this vaccine is not working.,,,
