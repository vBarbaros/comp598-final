Unvaccinated in the icu is dominantly elderly, obese, hypertensive, diabete etc.

12,"@ABWood12 @CBCAlerts It's not a vaccine, it's gene therapy that alters your DNA permanently.  Also it's an experimental drug which hundreds of thousands have been injured and killed by this jab.

Not all are conspiracy theory nuts.",pos,covid-controversy,ca
20,"@CBCAlerts Good! As an ex-RCMP officer, I firmly believe it's a breach of the oath ""to serve and protect"" to refuse the vaccine.

21,"@sir_aleeu @Robrt_McMillan @CBCAlerts No but the vaccine kills the variant quicker than an unvaccinated person so the time they reduce the transmission rate. Only through travel no community spread. Also, the higher vaccination rate decreases the chance of creating a new mutation or variant in these countries",pos,vax-efficiency,ca
22,"@CaptainCanada76 @CBCNews This is true, you are correct.  Vaccinated people are 40% less likely to pass CoVid on to another person than an unvaccinated person.   Vaccine makes no difference in catching it.
