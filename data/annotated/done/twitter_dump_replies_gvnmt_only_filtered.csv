"@tabularasa100 @tr6_guy @fordnation @JustinTrudeau The alternative is that those most at risk get the vaccine (prophylactic) while the rest of the population develops immunities &amp; resiliency.

It is the vaccines that are causing the more severe and contagious variants. Variants that get around natural immunity are weaker.",,,

@CPHO_Canada If the vaccine does not preclude one from contracting or transmitting covid and the viral load has been shown to be the same between the vaccinated and unvaccinated how can the claim be made that the vaccine protects against serious illness?,,,

@hoffer_gena @CPHO_Canada @JustinTrudeau @AirCanada @WestJet You would have to screen for the actual VIRUS. Just having the vaccine does nothing for other people. You can still be infected and transmit…..plus you will likely have less or no symptoms which is even more dangerous to others. The vaccine doesn’t make you bulletproof.,,,
