1,@picardonhealth @geoffreyyork @globeandmail So you honestly think vaccine equity is going to slow down variants that much - at the end of 3 years from now we will still have a billion people who don‚Äôt get the shot - many of which don‚Äôt want it (I do). And I bet a good 50% of vaccinated will catch Covid &amp; make variants,neg,vax-efficiency,ca

5,"@globeandmail Yes, we have a new variant, 32 mutations to the S1. 
Makes it highly contagious, but so far more mild. 
This is the trend of viral evolution, more spread less dead. Will omicron follow this trend? Maybe

7,@woostiii @picardonhealth @globeandmail You believe that? You probably still believe if you get the vaccine you won't catch the virus.  I don't fear anything. I had it. I spent a day practicing golf in the sunshine and a few bowls of chicken soup. What more is there to do?,neg,vax-efficiency,ca
8,"@globeandmail The ""vaccine"" doesn't prevent transmission, contraction, hospitalization, or death. The headline makes no sense whatsoever.

Because it's a non-sterlizing therapeutic being used on a mass scale, the exact opposite is likely true with the ""vaccines"" driving mutations.",neg,vax-efficiency,ca

18,@CBCAlerts This is impossible. You have already told us that only the vaccinated can fly and that keeps everyone safe.
